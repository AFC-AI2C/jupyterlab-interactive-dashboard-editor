# JupyterLab Interactive Dashboard Editor

### Jupyter users can interactively create and customize dashboards from Jupyter Notebooks.

Creating a dashboard is a great way to present data analytics and information to general audiences. If you want to share your data, displaying Jupyter notebooks can get pretty lengthy with their cluttered, linear view. As a result, they are not easy to understand for general audiences who want to see your results, not your code.

  

The JupyterLab Interactive Dashboard Editor extension is a **live editor** that enables you to intuitively build aesthetic, **interactive** dashboards side-by-side with your notebook. You can rearrange, remove, and customize outputs (plots, widgets, text, etc.) in a **grid layout** by dragging cells directly from your notebook onto the dashboard.

  

Tools like [Voilà](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila) can already render dynamic web apps—however, they’re limited in their ability to conveniently customize layout and appearance. Simple tasks such as resizing a graph require you to rewrite templates in a separate templating language. Dashboarding should be as easy as dragging and dropping!

  

The Interactive Dashboard Editor extension solves this problem by integrating a **drag-and-drop** dashboard editor inside JupyterLab. Simply drag code cells outputs onto the dashboard, then arrange and size them in a live editor. Take advantage of our default design or further customize your dashboards with background colors, typefaces, font sizes/colors, and other adjustments.

  

> Project Health is a non-profit organization that collects international disease data. “Using the Interactive Dashboard Editor, we were able to easily publish live COVID-19 updates and data analytics directly from Jupyter Notebooks onto an interactive web-app. To ensure effectiveness and understandability, the layout was all custom-rendered, allowing for diverse audiences to read the data. In turn, this increased audience trust while interactive components added depth to the analysis.”
—Project Health manager, Noel James*
