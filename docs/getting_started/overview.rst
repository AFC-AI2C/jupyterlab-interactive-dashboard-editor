The JupyterLab Interactive Dashboard Editor extension is a live editor that enables you to intuitively build aesthetic, interactive dashboards side-by-side with your notebook. You can rearrange, remove, and customize outputs (plots, widgets, text, etc.) in a grid layout by dragging cells directly from your notebook onto the dashboard.
